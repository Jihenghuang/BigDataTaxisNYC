We wanted to test the hypothesis that there is a threshold below which it is faster to ride a Citi Bike in New York City than to take a taxi. This threshold may vary (or not exist) depending on conditions such as day of the week and time of the day. We compared three categories:\r\n* Total trips.\r\n* Weekdays in rush hour versus non rush hour.\r\n* Saturday mornings versus Saturday nights.\r\n\r\n## Data sources:\r\n\r\n* Citi Bike system data: January, May and September of 2015.\r\n* TLC yellow cab data for the same periods described above.\r\n\r\n![alt text][HW1_1]\r\n[HW1_1]: https://github.com/sarangof/BigDataTaxisNYC/blob/master/plots/Rush_difference_detail.png \"Total time difference.\"\r\n\r\nFor more information regarding methods and results, please refer to: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rCXrWBu7yBdaN905Gg6dNiYEn9mB1As-vGPwrrS726k/edit?usp=sharing\r\n\r\n",
